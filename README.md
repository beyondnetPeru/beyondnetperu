## About Me

Bridging 20+ years of software engineering excellence with the future of AI-driven architecture. Bilingual Technical Leader expert in orchestrating complex ecosystems across .NET and Node.js. I don’t just write code; I design scalable, high-impact solutions that transform business processes and lead high-performing hybrid teams toward technical excellence.

Throughout my career, I’ve navigated the full project lifecycle for industries like Retail, Supply Chain, and EdTech, managing budgets of $1M+ and leading teams of 30+ engineers. My approach combines the robustness of Enterprise Architecture (SOLID, DDD, Clean Architecture) with the agility of modern stacks (NestJS, React, Azure). I am at the forefront of the AI revolution, leveraging tools like Langchain, Semantic Kernel, and OpenAI to optimize development workflows and build the next generation of intelligent software.

Core Expertise:
- Backend: .NET Core/Web API, NodeJS, NestJS, ASP.NET MVC.
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Angular, Vue.js.
- Cloud & DevOps: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes.
- AI Ecosystem: Langchain, Gemini, GPT-4, Semantic Kernel, GitHub Copilot.
- Architecture: SOLID, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Design Patterns.

I am passionate about solving "unsolvable" problems and building tech cultures that thrive on innovation. If you are looking for a Senior Architect, Tech Lead or Tech Manager who understands both the legacy stability and the AI-driven future.
